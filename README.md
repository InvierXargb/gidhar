SAVE THE FILE IN YOUR PENDRIVE AND USE AUTORUN PENDRIVE
TO RUN IT ON SYSTEM BOOT.

ENJECT THE PENDRIVE ON THE VICTIM SYSTEM 
AND WAIT , BUT CHANGE THE CONFIG OF THE FILE TO MAKE NECESSARY 
CHANGES ,

THE DEFAULT DRIVE LETTER IS SET F: BUT IF THE USER PENDRIVE LETTER
IS SOMETHING ELSE , SO YOU HAVE TO MONITOR IT FOR PROPER WORKING.

NEXT PATCH:
~ ADDING AUTOMATIC PENDRIVE LETTER DETECTION
~ MAKING A PY TOOL FOR CUSTOM FILE MAKER
~ MAKING USER FRIENDLY INTERFACE
